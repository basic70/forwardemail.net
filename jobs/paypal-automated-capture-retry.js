<p>Hello ${payment.user[config.userFields.fullEmail]},</p>

<p>We were unable to process your PayPal payment due to PayPal's infrastructure issues.</p>

<p><strong>What happened:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your payment was approved by PayPal but couldn't be captured within the required timeframe</li>
<li>We attempted multiple retries over several hours</li>
<li>No charge was made to your account</li>
<li>Your payment attempt has been cancelled</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Next steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Please retry your payment</strong> by visiting your <a href="${
                config.urls.web
              }/my-account/billing">account billing page</a></li>
<li>Consider using a credit card directly instead of PayPal for more reliable processing</li>
<li>If you continue to experience issues, please contact our support team</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why this happened:</strong></p>
<p>This issue is caused by PayPal's infrastructure problems, not your account or payment method. PayPal has had <a href="https://forwardemail.net/blog/docs/paypal-api-disaster-11-years-missing-features-broken-promises">documented API issues for over 11 years</a> that affect payment processing reliability.</p>

<p>We apologize for any inconvenience. This is entirely due to PayPal's technical limitations.</p>

<p><strong>Actions Taken:</strong></p>

<li>✅ Payment record deleted from database</li>
<li>✅ Attempted to cancel order on PayPal side</li>
<li>✅ User notified to retry payment</li>

<p><strong>Root Cause:</strong></p>
<p>This is another example of PayPal's systematic infrastructure failures documented in our <a href="https://forwardemail.net/blog/docs/paypal-api-disaster-11-years-missing-features-broken-promises">PayPal API disaster blog post</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Revenue Impact:</strong></p>
<p>Lost revenue: $${payment.amount / 100} (prevented by automated cleanup)</p>

<p><strong>Recommended Action:</strong></p>
<p>Monitor if this user successfully retries with a different payment method. Consider reaching out proactively if they don't retry within 24 hours.</p>
