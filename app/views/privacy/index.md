## Disclaimer

Please defer to our [Terms](/terms) as it applies sitewide.


## Information Not Collected

**With the exception of [errors](/faq#do-you-store-error-logs), [outbound SMTP emails](/faq#do-you-support-sending-email-with-smtp), and/or when spam or malicious activity is detected (e.g. for rate limiting):**

* We do not store any forwarded emails to disk storage nor databases.
* We do not store any metadata about emails to disk storage nor databases.
* We do not store any logs or IP addresses to disk storage nor databases.


## Information Collected

For transparency, at any time you can <a href="https://github.com/forwardemail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">view our source code</a> to see how the information below is collected and used:

**Strictly for functionality and to improve our service, we collect and store securely the following information:**

* We store emails and calendar information in your [encrypted SQLite database](/blog/docs/best-quantum-safe-encrypted-email-service) strictly for your IMAP/POP3/CalDAV/CardDAV access and mailbox functionality.
  * Note that if you are using our email forwarding services only, then no emails are stored to disk or database store as described in [Information Not Collected](#information-not-collected).
  * Our email forwarding services operate in-memory only (no writing to disk storage nor databases).
  * IMAP/POP3/CalDAV/CardDAV storage is encrypted-at-rest, encrypted-in-transit, and stored on a LUKS encrypted disk.
  * Backups for your IMAP/POP3/CalDAV/CardDAV storage is encrypted-at-rest, encrypted-in-transit, and stored on [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/).
* We store a cookie in a session for your website traffic.
* We store your email address that you provide us with.
* We store your domain names, aliases, and configurations that you provide us with.
* We store `4xx` and `5xx` SMTP response code [error logs](/faq#do-you-store-error-logs) for 7 days.
* We store [outbound SMTP emails](/faq#do-you-support-sending-email-with-smtp) for \~30 days.
  * This length varies based off the "Date" header; since we allow emails to be sent in the future if a future "Date" header exists.
  * **Note that once an email is successfully delivered or permanently errors, then we will redact and purge the message body.**
  * If you would like to configure your outbound SMTP email message body to be retained longer than the default of 0 days (after successfully delivery or permanent error), then go to Advanced Settings for your domain and enter a value between `0` and `30`.
  * Some users enjoy using the [My Account > Emails](/my-account/emails) preview feature to see how their emails are rendered, therefore we support a configurable retention period.
  * Note that we also support [OpenPGP/E2EE](/faq#do-you-support-openpgpmime-end-to-end-encryption-e2ee-and-web-key-directory-wkd).
* Any additional information you voluntarily provide us, such as comments or questions submitted to us by email or on our <a href="/help">help</a> page.


## Information Shared

We do not share your information with any third parties.  We also do not use any third-party analytics nor telemetry software services.

We may need to and will comply with court ordered legal requests (but keep in mind [we do not collect information mentioned above under "Information Not Collected"](#information-not-collected), so we will not be able to provide it to begin with).


## Information Removal

If at any time if you wish to remove information that you have provided us with, then go to <a href="/my-account/security">My Account > Security</a> and click "Delete Account".

Due to abuse prevention and mitigation, your account may require manual deletion review by our admins if you delete it within 5 days of your first payment.

This process usually takes less than 24 hours and was implemented due to users were spamming with our service, and then quickly deleting their accounts â€“ which prevented us from blocking their payment method fingerprint(s) in Stripe.
