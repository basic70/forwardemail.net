## Changes to the Agreement

This document is a derivative of the [Common Paper DPA Standard Terms (Version 1.0)](https://commonpaper.com/standards/data-processing-agreement/1.0) and the following changes have been made:

1. [Governing Law and Chosen Courts](#11-governing-law-and-chosen-courts) has been included as a section below with `Governing State` identified above.
2. [Service Provider Relationship](#12-service-provider-relationship) has been included as a section below.


## 1. Processor and Subprocessor Relationships

### 1. Provider as Processor

In situations where <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> is a Controller of the Customer Personal Data, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will be deemed a Processor that is Processing Personal Data on behalf of <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong>.

### 2. Provider as Subprocessor

In situations where <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> is a Processor of the Customer Personal Data, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will be deemed a Subprocessor of the Customer Personal Data.


## 2. Processing

### 1. Processing Details

Annex I(B) on the Cover Page describes the subject matter, nature, purpose, and duration of this Processing, as well as the <strong class="text-monospace">Categories of Personal Data</strong> collected and <strong class="text-monospace">Categories of Data Subjects</strong>.

### 2. Processing Instructions

<strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> instructs <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> to Process Customer Personal Data: (a) to provide and maintain the Service; (b) as may be further specified through <strong class="text-monospace">Customer's</strong> use of the Service; (c) as documented in the <strong class="text-monospace">Agreement</strong>; and (d) as documented in any other written instructions given by <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> and acknowledged by <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> about Processing Customer Personal Data under this DPA. <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will abide by these instructions unless prohibited from doing so by Applicable Laws. <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will immediately inform <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> if it is unable to follow the Processing instructions. <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> has given and will only give instructions that comply with Applicable Laws.

### 3. Processing by Provider

<strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will only Process Customer Personal Data in accordance with this DPA, including the details in the Cover Page. If <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> updates the Service to update existing or include new products, features, or functionality, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> may change the <strong class="text-monospace">Categories of Data Subjects</strong>, <strong class="text-monospace">Categories of Personal Data</strong>, <strong class="text-monospace">Special Category Data</strong>, <strong class="text-monospace">Special Category Data Restrictions or Safeguards</strong>, <strong class="text-monospace">Frequency of Transfer</strong>, <strong class="text-monospace">Nature and Purpose of Processing</strong>, and <strong class="text-monospace">Duration of Processing</strong> as needed to reflect the updates by notifying <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> of the updates and changes.

### 4. Customer Processing

Where <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> is a Processor and <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> is a Subprocessor, <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> will comply with all Applicable Laws that apply to <strong class="text-monospace">Customer's</strong> Processing of Customer Personal Data. <strong class="text-monospace">Customer's</strong> agreement with its Controller will similarly require <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> to comply with all Applicable Laws that apply to <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> as a Processor. In addition, <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> will comply with the Subprocessor requirements in <strong class="text-monospace">Customer's</strong> agreement with its Controller.

### 5. Consent to Processing

<strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> has complied with and will continue to comply with all Applicable Data Protection Laws concerning its provision of Customer Personal Data to <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> and/or the Service, including making all disclosures, obtaining all consents, providing adequate choice, and implementing relevant safeguards required under Applicable Data Protection Laws.

### 6. Subprocessors

a. <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will not provide, transfer, or hand over any Customer Personal Data to a Subprocessor unless <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> has approved the Subprocessor. The current list of <strong class="text-monospace">Approved Subprocessors</strong> includes the identities of the Subprocessors, their country of location, and their anticipated Processing tasks. <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will inform <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> at least 10 business days in advance and in writing of any intended changes to the <strong class="text-monospace">Approved Subprocessors</strong> whether by addition or replacement of a Subprocessor, which allows <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> to have enough time to object to the changes before the <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> begins using the new Subprocessor(s). <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will give <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> the information necessary to allow <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> to exercise its right to object to the change to <strong class="text-monospace">Approved Subprocessors</strong>. <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> has 30 days after notice of a change to the <strong class="text-monospace">Approved Subprocessors</strong> to object, otherwise <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> will be deemed to accept the changes. If <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> objects to the change within 30 days of notice, <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> and <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will cooperate in good faith to resolve <strong class="text-monospace">Customer's</strong> objection or concern.

b. When engaging a Subprocessor, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will have a written agreement with the Subprocessor that ensures the Subprocessor only accesses and uses Customer Personal Data (i) to the extent required to perform the obligations subcontracted to it, and (ii) consistent with the terms of <strong class="text-monospace">Agreement</strong>.

c. If the GDPR applies to the Processing of Customer Personal Data, (i) the data protection obligations described in this DPA (as referred to in Article 28(3) of the GDPR, if applicable) are also imposed on the Subprocessor, and (ii) <strong class="text-monospace">Provider's</strong> agreement with the Subprocessor will incorporate these obligations, including details about how <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> and its Subprocessor will coordinate to respond to inquiries or requests about the Processing of Customer Personal Data. In addition, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will share, at <strong class="text-monospace">Customer's</strong> request, a copy of its agreements (including any amendments) with its Subprocessors. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> may redact the text of its agreement with its Subprocessor prior to sharing a copy.

d. <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> remains fully liable for all obligations subcontracted to its Subprocessors, including the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors in Processing Customer Personal Data. <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will notify Customer of any failure by its Subprocessors to fulfill a material obligation about Customer Personal Data under the agreement between <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> and the Subprocessor.


## 3. Restricted Transfers

### 1. Authorization

<strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> agrees that <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> may transfer Customer Personal Data outside the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other relevant geographic territory as necessary to provide the Service. If <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> transfers Customer Personal Data to a territory for which the European Commission or other relevant supervisory authority has not issued an adequacy decision, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will implement appropriate safeguards for the transfer of Customer Personal Data to that territory consistent with Applicable Data Protection Laws.

### 2. Ex-EEA Transfers

<strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> and <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> agree that if the GDPR protects the transfer of Customer Personal Data, the transfer is from <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> from within the EEA to <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> outside of the EEA, and the transfer is not governed by an adequacy decision made by the European Commission, then by entering into this DPA, <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> and <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> are deemed to have signed the EEA SCCs and their Annexes, which are incorporated by reference. Any such transfer is made pursuant to the EEA SCCs, which are completed as follows:

a. Module Two (Controller to Processor) of the EEA SCCs apply when <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> is a Controller and <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> is Processing Customer Personal Data for <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> as a Processor.

b. Module Three (Processor to Sub-Processor) of the EEA SCCs apply when <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> is a Processor and <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> is Processing Customer Personal Data on behalf of <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> as a Subprocessor.

c. For each module, the following applies (when applicable):

1. The optional docking clause in Clause 7 does not apply;

2. In Clause 9, Option 2 (general written authorization) applies, and the minimum time period for prior notice of Subprocessor changes is 10 business days;

3. In Clause 11, the optional language does not apply;

4. All square brackets in Clause 13 are removed;

5. In Clause 17 (Option 1), the EEA SCCs will be governed by the laws of <strong class="text-monospace">Governing Member State</strong>;

6. In Clause 18(b), disputes will be resolved in the courts of the <strong class="text-monospace">Governing Member State</strong>; and

7. The Cover Page to this DPA contains the information required in Annex I, Annex II, and Annex III of the EEA SCCs.

### 3. Ex-UK Transfers

<strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> and <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> agree that if the UK GDPR protects the transfer of Customer Personal Data, the transfer is from <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> from within the United Kingdom to <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> outside of the United Kingdom, and the transfer is not governed by an adequacy decision made by the United Kingdom Secretary of State, then by entering into this DPA, <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> and <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> are deemed to have signed the UK Addendum and their Annexes, which are incorporated by reference. Any such transfer is made pursuant to the UK Addendum, which is completed as follows:

a. Section 3.2 of this DPA contains the information required in Table 2 of the UK Addendum.

b. Table 4 of the UK Addendum is modified as follows: Neither party may end the UK Addendum as set out in Section 19 of the UK Addendum; to the extent ICO issues a revised Approved Addendum under Section ‎18 of the UK Addendum, the parties will work in good faith to revise this DPA accordingly.

c. The Cover Page contains the information required by Annex 1A, Annex 1B, Annex II, and Annex III of the UK Addendum.

### 4. Other International Transfers

For Personal Data transfers where Swiss law (and not the law in any EEA member state or the United Kingdom) applies to the international nature of the transfer, references to the GDPR in Clause 4 of the EEA SCCs are, to the extent legally required, amended to refer to the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act or its successor instead, and the concept of supervisory authority will include the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.


## 4. Security Incident Response

1. Upon becoming aware of any Security Incident, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will: (a) notify <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> without undue delay when feasible, but no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the Security Incident; (b) provide timely information about the Security Incident as it becomes known or as is reasonably requested by <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong>; and (c) promptly take reasonable steps to contain and investigate the Security Incident. <strong class="text-monospace">Provider's</strong> notification of or response to a Security Incident as required by this DPA will not be construed as an acknowledgment by <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> of any fault or liability for the Security Incident.


## 5. Audit & Reports

### 1. Audit Rights

<strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will give <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate its compliance with this DPA and <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections by <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong>, to assess <strong class="text-monospace">Provider's</strong> compliance with this DPA. However, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> may restrict access to data or information if <strong class="text-monospace">Customer's</strong> access to the information would negatively impact <strong class="text-monospace">Provider's</strong> intellectual property rights, confidentiality obligations, or other obligations under Applicable Laws. <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> acknowledges and agrees that it will only exercise its audit rights under this DPA and any audit rights granted by Applicable Data Protection Laws by instructing <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> to comply with the reporting and due diligence requirements below. <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will maintain records of its compliance with this DPA for 3 years after the DPA ends.

### 2. Security Reports

<strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> acknowledges that <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> is regularly audited against the standards defined in the <strong class="text-monospace">Security Policy</strong> by independent third-party auditors. Upon written request, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will give <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong>, on a confidential basis, a summary copy of its then-current Report so that <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> can verify <strong class="text-monospace">Provider's</strong> compliance with the standards defined in the <strong class="text-monospace">Security Policy</strong>.

### 3. Security Due Diligence

In addition to the Report, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will respond to reasonable requests for information made by <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> to confirm <strong class="text-monospace">Provider's</strong> compliance with this DPA, including responses to information security, due diligence, and audit questionnaires, or by giving additional information about its information security program. All such requests must be in writing and made to the <strong class="text-monospace">Provider Security Contact</strong> and may only be made once a year.


## 6. Coordination & Cooperation

### 1. Response to Inquiries

If <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> receives any inquiry or request from anyone else about the Processing of Customer Personal Data, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will notify <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> about the request and <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will not respond to the request without <strong class="text-monospace">Customer's</strong> prior consent. Examples of these kinds of inquiries and requests include a judicial or administrative or regulatory agency order about Customer Personal Data where notifying <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> is not prohibited by Applicable Law, or a request from a data subject. If allowed by Applicable Law, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will follow <strong class="text-monospace">Customer's</strong> reasonable instructions about these requests, including providing status updates and other information reasonably requested by <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong>. If a data subject makes a valid request under Applicable Data Protection Laws to delete or opt out of <strong class="text-monospace">Customer's</strong> giving of Customer Personal Data to <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong>, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will assist <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> in fulfilling the request according to the Applicable Data Protection Law. <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance to <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong>, at <strong class="text-monospace">Customer's</strong> expense, in any legal response or other procedural action taken by <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> in response to a third-party request about <strong class="text-monospace">Provider's</strong> Processing of Customer Personal Data under this DPA.

### 2. DPIAs and DTIAs

If required by Applicable Data Protection Laws, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will reasonably assist <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> in conducting any mandated data protection impact assessments or data transfer impact assessments and consultations with relevant data protection authorities, taking into consideration the nature of the Processing and Customer Personal Data.


## 7. Deletion of Customer Personal Data

### 1. Deletion by Customer

<strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will enable <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> to delete Customer Personal Data in a manner consistent with the functionality of the Services. <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will comply with this instruction as soon as reasonably practicable except where further storage of Customer Personal Data is required by Applicable Law.

### 2. Deletion at DPA Expiration

a. After the DPA expires, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will return or delete Customer Personal Data at <strong class="text-monospace">Customer's</strong> instruction unless further storage of Customer Personal Data is required or authorized by Applicable Law. If return or destruction is impracticable or prohibited by Applicable Laws, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will make reasonable efforts to prevent additional Processing of Customer Personal Data and will continue to protect the Customer Personal Data remaining in its possession, custody, or control. For example, Applicable Laws may require <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> to continue hosting or Processing Customer Personal Data.

b. If <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> and <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> have entered the EEA SCCs or the UK Addendum as part of this DPA, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> will only give <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> the certification of deletion of Personal Data described in Clause 8.1(d) and Clause 8.5 of the EEA SCCs if <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> asks for one.


## 8. Limitation of Liability

### 1. Liability Caps and Damages Waiver

**To the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Data Protection Laws, each party's total cumulative liability to the other party arising out of or related to this DPA will be subject to the waivers, exclusions, and limitations of liability stated in the <strong class="text-monospace">Agreement</strong>.**

### 2. Related-Party Claims

**Any claims made against <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> or its Affiliates arising out of or related to this DPA may only be brought by the <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> entity that is a party to the <strong class="text-monospace">Agreement</strong>.**

### 3. Exceptions

1. This DPA does not limit any liability to an individual about the individual's data protection rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws. In addition, this DPA does not limit any liability between the parties for violations of the EEA SCCs or UK Addendum.


## 9. Conflicts Between Documents

1. This DPA forms part of and supplements the Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between this DPA, the <strong class="text-monospace">Agreement</strong>, or any of their parts, the part listed earlier will control over the part listed later for that inconsistency: (1) the EEA SCCs or the UK Addendum, (2) this DPA, and then (3) the <strong class="text-monospace">Agreement</strong>.


## 10. Term of Agreement

This DPA will start when <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> and <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> agree to a Cover Page for the DPA and sign or electronically accept the <strong class="text-monospace">Agreement</strong> and will continue until the <strong class="text-monospace">Agreement</strong> expires or is terminated. However, <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> and <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> will each remain subject to the obligations in this DPA and Applicable Data Protection Laws until <strong class="text-monospace">Customer</strong> stops transferring Customer Personal Data to <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> and <strong class="text-monospace">Provider</strong> stops Processing Customer Personal Data.


## 11. Governing Law and Chosen Courts

Notwithstanding the governing law or similar clauses of the <strong class="text-monospace">Agreement</strong>, all interpretations and disputes about this DPA will be governed by the laws of the <strong class="text-monospace">Governing State</strong> without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. In addition, and notwithstanding the forum selection, jurisdiction, or similar clauses of the <strong class="text-monospace">Agreement</strong>, the parties agree to bring any legal suit, action, or proceeding about this DPA in, and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of, the courts of the <strong class="text-monospace">Governing State</strong>.


## 12. Service Provider Relationship
