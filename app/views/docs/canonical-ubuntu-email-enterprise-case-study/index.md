## Foreword

In the world of open-source software, few names carry as much weight as [Canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_\(company\)), the company behind [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu), one of the most popular Linux distributions globally. With a vast ecosystem spanning multiple distributions including Ubuntu, [Kubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubuntu), [Lubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubuntu), [Edubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edubuntu), and others, Canonical faced unique challenges in managing email addresses across their numerous domains. This case study explores how Canonical partnered with Forward Email to create a seamless, secure, and privacy-focused enterprise email management solution that aligns perfectly with their open-source values.


## The Challenge: Managing a Complex Email Ecosystem

Canonical's ecosystem is diverse and expansive. With millions of users worldwide and thousands of contributors across various projects, managing email addresses across multiple domains presented significant challenges. Core contributors needed official email addresses (@ubuntu.com, @kubuntu.org, etc.) that reflected their involvement with the project while maintaining security and ease of use through a robust Ubuntu domain management system.

Before implementing Forward Email, Canonical struggled with:

* Managing email addresses across multiple domains (@ubuntu.com, @kubuntu.org, @lubuntu.me, @edubuntu.org, and @ubuntu.net)
* Providing a consistent email experience for core contributors
* Integrating email services with their existing [Ubuntu One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_One) Single Sign-On (SSO) system
* Finding a solution that aligned with their commitment to privacy, security, and open-source email security
* Scaling their secure email infrastructure cost-effectively


## Key Takeaways

* Canonical successfully implemented a unified email management solution across multiple Ubuntu domains
* Forward Email's 100% open-source approach aligned perfectly with Canonical's values
* SSO integration with Ubuntu One provides seamless authentication for contributors
* Quantum-resistant encryption ensures long-term security for all email communications
* The solution scales cost-effectively to support Canonical's growing contributor base


## Why Forward Email

As the only 100% open-source email service provider with a focus on privacy and security, Forward Email was a natural fit for Canonical's enterprise email forwarding needs. Our values aligned perfectly with Canonical's commitment to open-source software and privacy.

Key factors that made Forward Email the ideal choice included:

1. **Complete open-source codebase**: Our entire platform is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub), allowing for transparency and community contributions. Unlike many "privacy-focused" email providers who only open-source their frontends while keeping their backends closed, we've made our entire codebase—both frontend and backend—available for anyone to inspect at [GitHub](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net).

2. **Privacy-focused approach**: Unlike other providers, we don't store emails in shared databases, and we use robust encryption with TLS. Our fundamental privacy philosophy is simple: **your emails belong to you and only you**. This principle guides every technical decision we make, from how we handle email forwarding to how we implement encryption.

3. **No reliance on third parties**: We don't use Amazon SES or other third-party services, giving us complete control over the email infrastructure and eliminating potential privacy leaks through third-party services.

4. **Cost-effective scaling**: Our pricing model allows organizations to scale without paying per user, making it ideal for Canonical's large contributor base.

5. **Quantum-resistant encryption**: We use individually encrypted SQLite mailboxes with [ChaCha20-Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305) as the cipher for [quantum-resistant encryption](/blog/docs/best-quantum-safe-encrypted-email-service). Each mailbox is a separate encrypted file, meaning access to one user's data doesn't grant access to others.


## The Implementation: Seamless SSO Integration

One of the most critical aspects of the implementation was integrating with Canonical's existing Ubuntu One SSO system. This integration would allow core contributors to manage their @ubuntu.com email addresses using their existing Ubuntu One credentials.

```

### Technical Implementation Details

The integration between Forward Email and Ubuntu One SSO was accomplished through a custom implementation of the passport-ubuntu authentication strategy. This allowed for a seamless authentication flow between Ubuntu One and Forward Email's systems.

#### The Authentication Flow

The authentication process works as follows:

1. Users visit the dedicated Ubuntu email management page at [forwardemail.net/ubuntu](https://forwardemail.net/ubuntu)
2. They click "Log in with Ubuntu One" and are redirected to the Ubuntu SSO service
3. After authenticating with their Ubuntu One credentials, they are redirected back to Forward Email with their authenticated profile
4. Forward Email verifies their contributor status and provisions or manages their email address accordingly

The technical implementation leveraged the [`passport-ubuntu`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-ubuntu) package, which is a [Passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport) strategy for authenticating with Ubuntu using [OpenID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID). The configuration included:

```javascript
passport.use(new UbuntuStrategy({
  returnURL: process.env.UBUNTU_CALLBACK_URL,
  realm: process.env.UBUNTU_REALM,
  stateless: true
}, function(identifier, profile, done) {
  // User verification and email provisioning logic
}));
```

#### Launchpad API Integration and Validation

A critical component of our implementation is the integration with [Launchpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchpad_\(website\))'s API to validate Ubuntu users and their team memberships. We created reusable helper functions to handle this integration efficiently and reliably.

The `sync-ubuntu-user.js` helper function is responsible for validating users through the Launchpad API and managing their email addresses. Here's a simplified version of how it works:

```javascript
async function syncUbuntuUser(user, map) {
  try {
    // Validate user object
    if (!_.isObject(user) ||
        !isSANB(user[fields.ubuntuUsername]) ||
        !isSANB(user[fields.ubuntuProfileID]) ||
        !isEmail(user.email))
      throw new TypeError('Invalid user object');

    // Get Ubuntu members map if not provided
    if (!(map instanceof Map))
      map = await getUbuntuMembersMap(resolver);

    // Check if user is banned
    if (user[config.userFields.isBanned]) {
      throw new InvalidUbuntuUserError('User was banned', { ignoreHook: true });
    }

    // Query Launchpad API to validate user
    const url = `https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/~${user[fields.ubuntuUsername]}`;
    const response = await retryRequest(url, { resolver });
    const json = await response.body.json();

    // Validate required boolean properties
    if (!json.is_valid)
      throw new InvalidUbuntuUserError('Property "is_valid" was false');

    if (!json.is_ubuntu_coc_signer)
      throw new InvalidUbuntuUserError('Property "is_ubuntu_coc_signer" was false');

    // Process each domain for the user
    await pMap([...map.keys()], async (name) => {
      // Find domain in database
      const domain = await Domains.findOne({
        name,
        plan: 'team',
        has_txt_record: true
      }).populate('members.user');

      // Process user's email alias for this domain
      if (map.get(name).has(user[fields.ubuntuUsername])) {
        // User is a member of this team, create or update alias
        let alias = await Aliases.findOne({
          user: user._id,
          domain: domain._id,
          name: user[fields.ubuntuUsername].toLowerCase()
        });

        if (!alias) {
          // Create new alias with appropriate error handling
          alias = await Aliases.create({
            user: user._id,
            domain: domain._id,
            name: user[fields.ubuntuUsername].toLowerCase(),
            recipients: [user.email],
            locale: user[config.lastLocaleField],
            is_enabled: true
          });

          // Notify admins about new alias creation
          await emailHelper({
            template: 'alert',
            message: {
              to: adminEmailsForDomain,
              subject: `New @${domain.name} email address created`
            },
            locals: {
              message: `A new email address ${user[fields.ubuntuUsername].toLowerCase()}@${domain.name} was created for ${user.email}`
            }
          });
        }
      }
    });

    return true;
  } catch (err) {
    // Handle and log errors
    await logErrorWithUser(err, user);
    throw err;
  }
}
```

To simplify the management of team memberships across different Ubuntu domains, we created a straightforward mapping between domain names and their corresponding Launchpad teams:

```javascript
ubuntuTeamMapping: {
  'ubuntu.com': '~ubuntumembers',
  'kubuntu.org': '~kubuntu-members',
  'lubuntu.me': '~lubuntu-members',
  'edubuntu.org': '~edubuntu-members',
  'ubuntustudio.com': '~ubuntustudio-core',
  'ubuntu.net': '~ubuntu-smtp-test'
},
```

This simple mapping allows us to automate the process of checking team memberships and provisioning email addresses, making the system easy to maintain and extend as new domains are added.

#### Error Handling and Notifications

We implemented a robust error handling system that:

1. Logs all errors with detailed user information
2. Emails the Ubuntu team when issues are detected
3. Notifies administrators when new contributors sign up and have email addresses created
4. Handles edge cases such as users who haven't signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct

This ensures that any issues are quickly identified and addressed, maintaining the integrity of the email system.


## DNS Configuration and Email Routing

For each domain managed through Forward Email, Canonical added a simple DNS TXT record for validation:

```sh
❯ dig ubuntu.com txt
ubuntu.com.             600     IN      TXT     "forward-email-site-verification=6IsURgl2t7"
```

This verification record confirms domain ownership and enables our system to securely manage email for these domains. Canonical routes mail through our service via Postfix, which provides a reliable and secure email delivery infrastructure.


## Results: Streamlined Email Management and Enhanced Security

The implementation of Forward Email's enterprise solution has delivered significant benefits for Canonical's email management across all their domains:
