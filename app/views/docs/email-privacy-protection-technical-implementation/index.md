## Foreword

Email forwarding is a powerful tool that can transform how you manage your online communications. Whether you're a business owner looking to create professional email addresses with your custom domain, a privacy-conscious individual seeking to protect your primary email, or a developer needing flexible email management, understanding email forwarding is essential in today's digital landscape.

At Forward Email, we've built the world's most secure, private, and flexible email forwarding service. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explain how email forwarding works (from both technical and practical perspectives), walk you through our simple setup process, and highlight why our service stands out from competitors.


## What is Email Forwarding

Email forwarding is a process that automatically redirects emails sent to one email address to another destination address. For example, when someone sends an email to <contact@yourdomain.com>, that message can be automatically forwarded to your personal Gmail, Outlook, or any other email account.

This seemingly simple capability offers powerful benefits:

* **Professional Branding**: Use email addresses with your custom domain (<you@yourdomain.com>) while managing everything from your existing personal inbox
* **Privacy Protection**: Create disposable or purpose-specific addresses that shield your primary email
* **Simplified Management**: Consolidate multiple email addresses into a single inbox
* **Flexibility**: Create unlimited addresses for different purposes without managing multiple accounts


## How Email Forwarding Works: The Technical Explanation

For those interested in the technical details, let's explore what happens behind the scenes when an email is forwarded.

### The Email Forwarding Process

1. **DNS Configuration**: The process begins with your domain's DNS records. When you set up email forwarding, you configure MX (Mail Exchange) records that tell the internet where emails for your domain should be delivered. These records point to our email servers.

2. **Email Reception**: When someone sends an email to your custom domain address (e.g., <you@yourdomain.com>), their email server looks up your domain's MX records and delivers the message to our servers.

3. **Processing and Authentication**: Our servers receive the email and perform several critical functions:
   * Verify the sender's authenticity using protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
   * Scan for malicious content
   * Check the recipient against your forwarding rules

4. **Sender Rewriting**: This is where the magic happens. We implement Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) to modify the return path of the email. This is crucial because many email providers reject forwarded emails without proper SRS implementation, as they can appear to be spoofed.

5. **Forwarding**: The email is then sent to your destination address with the original content intact.

6. **Delivery**: The email arrives in your inbox, appearing as if it was sent to your forwarding address, maintaining the professional appearance of your custom domain.

### The Role of SRS (Sender Rewriting Scheme)

SRS deserves special attention because it's essential for reliable email forwarding. When an email is forwarded, the sender's address needs to be rewritten to ensure the email passes SPF checks at the final destination.

Without SRS, forwarded emails often fail SPF verification and get marked as spam or rejected entirely. Our implementation of SRS ensures your forwarded emails are delivered reliably while maintaining the original sender information in a way that's transparent to you.


## How Email Forwarding Works: The Simple Explanation

If the technical details seem overwhelming, here's a simpler way to understand email forwarding:

Think of email forwarding like mail forwarding for physical mail. When you move to a new home, you can ask the postal service to forward all mail from your old address to your new one. Email forwarding works similarly, but for digital messages.

With Forward Email:

1. You tell us which email addresses on your domain you want to set up (like <sales@yourdomain.com> or <contact@yourdomain.com>)
2. You tell us where you want those emails delivered (like your Gmail or Outlook account)
3. We handle all the technical details to make sure emails sent to your custom addresses arrive safely in your specified inbox

It's that simple! You get to use professional email addresses without changing your existing email workflow.


## Setting Up Email Forwarding with Forward Email

One of the biggest advantages of Forward Email is how easy it is to set up. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Sign Up for an Account

Visit [forwardemail.net](https://forwardemail.net) and create a free account. Our signup process takes less than a minute.

### 2. Add Your Domain

Once logged in, add the domain you want to use for email forwarding. If you don't already own a domain, you'll need to purchase one from a domain registrar first.

### 3. Configure DNS Records

We'll provide you with the exact DNS records you need to add to your domain. Typically, this involves:

* Adding MX records that point to our email servers
* Adding TXT records for verification and security

Most domain registrars have a simple interface for adding these records. We provide detailed guides for all major domain registrars to make this process as smooth as possible.

### 4. Create Email Forwards

After your DNS records are verified (which usually takes just a few minutes), you can create email forwards. Simply specify:

* The email address on your domain (e.g., <contact@yourdomain.com>)
* The destination where you want emails sent (e.g., your personal Gmail address)

### 5. Start Using Your New Email Addresses

That's it! Emails sent to your custom domain addresses will now be forwarded to your specified destination. You can create as many forwards as you need, including catch-all addresses that forward all emails sent to any address on your domain.


## Advanced Features of Forward Email

While basic email forwarding is powerful on its own, Forward Email offers several advanced features that set us apart:

### Disposable Addresses

Create specific or anonymous email addresses that forward to your main account. You can assign labels to these addresses and enable or disable them at any time to keep your inbox organized. Your actual email address is never exposed.

### Multiple Recipients and Wildcards

Forward a single address to multiple recipients, making it easy to share information with a team. You can also use wildcard addresses (catch-all forwarding) to receive emails sent to any address on your domain.

### "Send Mail As" Integration

You'll never have to leave your inbox to send emails from your custom domain. Send and reply to messages as if they're from <you@yourdomain.com> directly from your Gmail or Outlook account.

### Quantum-Resistant Security

We're the world's first and only email service to use quantum-resistant encryption, protecting your communications against even the most advanced future threats.

### Individually Encrypted SQLite Mailboxes

Unlike other providers that store all user emails in shared databases, we use individually encrypted SQLite mailboxes for unparalleled privacy and security.


## Why Choose Forward Email Over Competitors

The email forwarding market has several players, but Forward Email stands out in several important ways:

### 1. 100% Open-Source

We're the only email forwarding service that is completely open-source, including our backend code. This transparency builds trust and allows independent security audits. Other services may claim to be open-source but don't release their backend code.

### 2. Privacy-Focused

We created this service because you have a right to privacy. We use robust encryption with TLS, do not store SMTP logs (except for errors and outbound SMTP), and do not write your emails to disk storage.

### 3. No Third-Party Reliance

Unlike competitors who rely on Amazon SES or other third-party services, we maintain complete control over our infrastructure, enhancing both reliability and privacy.

### 4. Cost-Effective Pricing

Our pricing model allows you to scale cost-effectively. We don't charge per user, and you can pay as you go for storage. At $3/month, we offer more features at a lower price than competitors like Gandi ($3.99/month).

### 5. Unlimited Resources

We don't impose artificial limits on domains, aliases, or email addresses like many competitors do.

### 6. Trusted by Major Organizations

Our service is used by over 500,000 domains, including notable organizations like [The U.S. Naval Academy](/blog/docs/federal-government-email-service-section-889-compliant), Netflix, [The Linux Foundation](/blog/docs/linux-foundation-email-enterprise-case-study), [Canonical/Ubuntu](/blog/docs/canonical-ubuntu-email-enterprise-case-study), Disney Ad Sales, and many others.


## Common Use Cases for Email Forwarding

Email forwarding solves numerous challenges for different types of users:

### For Businesses

* Create professional email addresses for different departments (sales@, support@, info@)
* Easily manage team email communications
* Maintain brand consistency in all communications
* Simplify email management during staff changes

### For Developers

* Set up automated notification systems
* Create purpose-specific addresses for different projects
* Integrate with webhooks for advanced automation
* Leverage our API for custom implementations

### For Privacy-Conscious Individuals

* Create separate email addresses for different services to track who shares your information
* Use disposable addresses for one-time signups
* Maintain privacy by shielding your primary email address
* Easily disable addresses that start receiving spam


## Best Practices for Email Forwarding

To get the most out of email forwarding, consider these best practices:

### 1. Use Descriptive Addresses

Create email addresses that clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., <newsletter@yourdomain.com>, <shopping@yourdomain.com>) to help organize your incoming mail.

### 2. Implement Proper Authentication

Ensure your domain has proper SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to maximize deliverability. Forward Email makes this easy with our guided setup.

### 3. Regularly Review Your Forwards

Periodically audit your email forwards to disable any that are no longer needed or are receiving excessive spam.

### 4. Set Up "Send Mail As" for Seamless Replies

Configure your main email client to send mail as your custom domain addresses for a consistent experience when replying to forwarded emails.

### 5. Use Catch-All Addresses Cautiously

While catch-all addresses are convenient, they can potentially receive more spam. Consider creating specific forwards for important communications.
