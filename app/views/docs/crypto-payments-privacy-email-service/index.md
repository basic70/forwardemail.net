## Foreword

At [Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net), we're constantly looking for ways to improve your [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy) and security while making our service more accessible. Today, we're excited to announce that we now accept [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) payments through [Stripe's](https://stripe.com) crypto payment integration.


## Why Crypto Payments Matter

[Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy) has always been at the core of our service. While we've offered various payment methods in the past, cryptocurrency payments provide an additional layer of privacy that aligns perfectly with our mission. By paying with crypto, you can:

* Maintain greater anonymity when purchasing our email services
* Reduce the personal information tied to your email account
* Keep your financial and email identities separate
* Support the growing [decentralized finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) ecosystem


## How It Works

We've integrated [Stripe's](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto) crypto payment system to make the process as seamless as possible. Here's how you can pay for Forward Email services using cryptocurrency:

    A[Start Checkout] --> B[Select Crypto as Payment Method]
    B --> C[Choose USDC on Preferred Network]
    C --> D[Connect Your Wallet]
    D --> E[Confirm Transaction]
    E --> F[Payment Complete]
    F --> G[Service Activated]
```

1. **Select Crypto as Your Payment Method**: When checking out, you'll see "Crypto" as a payment option alongside traditional methods like credit cards.

2. **Choose Your Cryptocurrency**: Currently, we accept [USDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USD_Coin) (USD Coin) on multiple blockchains including [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org), [Solana](https://solana.com), and [Polygon](https://polygon.technology). USDC is a stable cryptocurrency that maintains a 1:1 value with the US dollar.

3. **Connect Your Wallet**: You'll be redirected to a secure page where you can connect your preferred crypto wallet. We support multiple wallet options including:
   * [MetaMask](https://metamask.io)
   * [Phantom](https://phantom.app)
   * [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
   * [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com) (compatible with many other wallets)

4. **Complete Your Payment**: Confirm the transaction in your wallet, and you're all set! The payment will be processed, and your Forward Email service will be activated immediately.


## Privacy Benefits

Using cryptocurrency for your Forward Email subscription enhances your privacy in several ways:

    A[Credit Card Payment] --> B[Personal Info Required]
    B --> C[Linked to Banking History]
    C --> D[Identity Easily Traced]
    end

    subgraph "Crypto Payment"
    E[Crypto Payment] --> F[Minimal Personal Info]
    F --> G[Pseudonymous Transaction]
    G --> H[Enhanced Privacy]
    end
```

* **Reduced Personal Information**: Unlike credit card payments, crypto transactions don't require your name, billing address, or other personal details. Learn more about [transaction privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_coin).
* **Separation from Traditional Banking**: Your payment can't be linked to your bank account or credit history. Read about [financial privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_privacy).
* **Blockchain Privacy**: While blockchain transactions are public, they're pseudonymous and not directly tied to your real-world identity. See [blockchain privacy techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_and_blockchain).
* **Consistent with Our Values**: As a privacy-focused email service, we believe in giving you control over your personal information at every step. Check out our [privacy policy](/privacy).


## Technical Details

For those interested in the technical aspects:

* We use [Stripe's](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/stablecoin-payments) crypto payment infrastructure, which handles all the complexity of blockchain transactions.
* Payments are made in [USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) on multiple blockchains including [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org), [Solana](https://solana.com), and [Polygon](https://polygon.technology).
* While you pay in cryptocurrency, we receive the equivalent value in USD, allowing us to maintain stable pricing.
