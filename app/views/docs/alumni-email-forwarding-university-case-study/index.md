### Real-World University Savings

Here's how much our partner universities save annually by choosing Forward Email over traditional providers:

| University              | Alumni Count | Annual Cost with Google | Annual Cost with Forward Email | Annual Savings |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| University of Cambridge | 30,000       | $90,000                 | $3,000                         | $87,000        |
| Swarthmore College      | 5,000        | $15,000                 | $3,000                         | $12,000        |

> \[!NOTE]
> Forward Email enterprise only costs $250/month typically, with no extra cost per user, whitelisted API rate limitations, and the only additional cost is storage if you need additional GB/TB for students (+$3 per 10 GB additional storage). We use NVMe SSD drives for fast support of IMAP/POP3/SMTP/CalDAV/CardDAV as well.

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> Unlike Google and Microsoft, who have repeatedly increased their prices while integrating AI features that analyze your data, Forward Email maintains stable pricing with a strict privacy focus. We don't use AI, don't track usage patterns, and don't store logs or emails to disk (all processing is done in-memory), ensuring complete privacy for your alumni communications.

This represents a significant cost reduction compared to traditional email hosting solutions—funds that universities can redirect to scholarships, research, or other mission-critical activities. According to a 2023 analysis by Email Vendor Selection, educational institutions are increasingly seeking cost-effective alternatives to traditional email providers as prices continue to rise with the integration of AI features ([Email Vendor Selection, 2023](https://www.emailvendorselection.com/email-service-provider-list/)).


## The University Alumni Email Challenge

For universities, providing lifetime email addresses to alumni presents a unique set of challenges that traditional email solutions struggle to address effectively. As noted in a comprehensive discussion on ServerFault, universities with large user bases require specialized email solutions that balance performance, security, and cost-effectiveness ([ServerFault, 2009](https://serverfault.com/questions/97364/what-is-the-best-mail-server-for-a-university-with-a-large-amount-of-users)).

### The Value of Alumni Email Identity

Alumni email addresses (like `firstname.lastname@cl.cam.ac.uk` or `username@terpalum.umd.edu`) serve multiple important functions:

* Maintaining institutional connection and brand identity
* Facilitating ongoing communication with the university
* Enhancing professional credibility for graduates
* Supporting alumni networking and community building
* Providing a stable, lifetime contact point

Research by Tekade (2020) highlights that educational email addresses provide numerous benefits to alumni, including access to academic resources, professional credibility, and exclusive discounts on various services ([Medium, 2020](https://medium.com/coders-capsule/top-20-benefits-of-having-an-educational-email-address-91a09795e05)).

> \[!TIP]
> Visit our new [AlumniEmail.com](https://alumniemail.com) directory for a comprehensive resource on university alumni email services, including setup guides, best practices, and a searchable directory of alumni email domains. It serves as a central hub for all alumni email information.

### Traditional Solutions Fall Short

Conventional email systems present several limitations when applied to alumni email needs:

* **Cost Prohibitive**: Per-user licensing models become financially unsustainable for large alumni bases
* **Administrative Burden**: Managing thousands or millions of accounts requires significant IT resources
* **Security Concerns**: Maintaining security for dormant accounts increases vulnerability
* **Limited Flexibility**: Rigid systems can't adapt to the unique needs of alumni email forwarding
* **Privacy Issues**: Many providers scan email content for advertising purposes

A Quora discussion on university email maintenance reveals that security concerns are a major reason universities might limit or cancel alumni email addresses, as unused accounts can be vulnerable to hacking and identity theft ([Quora, 2011](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-cost-for-a-college-or-university-to-maintain-edu-e-mail-addresses)).

### The Forward Email Solution

Our approach addresses these challenges through a fundamentally different model:

* Email forwarding rather than hosting
* Flat-fee pricing instead of per-user costs
* Open-source architecture for transparency and security
* Privacy-first design with no content scanning
* Specialized features for university identity management


## Technical Implementation: How It Works

Our solution leverages a sophisticated yet elegantly simple technical architecture to deliver reliable, secure email forwarding at scale.

### Core Architecture

The Forward Email system consists of several key components:

* Distributed MX servers for high availability
* Real-time forwarding with no message storage
* Comprehensive email authentication
* Custom domain and subdomain support
* API-driven account management

According to IT professionals on ServerFault, for universities seeking to implement their own email solutions, Postfix is recommended as the best Mail Transfer Agent (MTA), while Courier or Dovecot are preferred for IMAP/POP3 access ([ServerFault, 2009](https://serverfault.com/questions/97364/what-is-the-best-mail-server-for-a-university-with-a-large-amount-of-users)). However, our solution eliminates the need for universities to manage these complex systems themselves.

### Integration with University Systems

We've developed seamless integration pathways with existing university infrastructure:

* Automated provisioning through [RESTful API](https://forwardemail.net/email-api) integration
* Custom branding options for university portals
* Flexible alias management for departments and organizations
* Batch operations for efficient administration

### API-Driven Management

Our [RESTful API](https://forwardemail.net/email-api) enables universities to automate email management:

```javascript
// Example: Creating a new alumni email address
const response = await fetch('https://forwardemail.net/api/v1/domains/example.edu/aliases', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Basic ${Buffer.from(YOUR_API_TOKEN + ":").toString('base64')}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'alumni.john.smith',
    recipients: ['johnsmith@gmail.com'],
    has_recipient_verification: true
  })
});
```

### DNS Configuration and Verification

Proper DNS configuration is critical for email delivery. Our team assists with:

* [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) configuration including MX records
* Comprehensive email security implementation using our open-source [mailauth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mailauth) package, a Swiss Army knife for email authentication that handles:
  * [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) (Sender Policy Framework) to prevent email spoofing
  * [DKIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail) (DomainKeys Identified Mail) for email authentication
  * [DMARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_authentication) (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) for policy enforcement
  * [MTA-STS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS) (SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security) to enforce TLS encryption
  * [ARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail#Authenticated_Received_Chain) (Authenticated Received Chain) to maintain authentication when messages are forwarded
  * [SRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Rewriting_Scheme) (Sender Rewriting Scheme) to preserve SPF validation through forwarding
  * [BIMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_authentication) (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) for logo display in supporting email clients
* DNS TXT record verification for domain ownership

The `mailauth` package (<http://npmjs.com/package/mailauth>) is the fully open-source solution that handles all aspects of email authentication in one integrated library. Unlike proprietary solutions, this approach ensures transparency, regular security updates, and complete control over the email authentication process.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

Before full deployment, we conduct rigorous testing:

* End-to-end email delivery testing
* Load testing for high-volume scenarios
* Security penetration testing
* API integration validation
* User acceptance testing with alumni representatives
