## Foreword

At Forward Email, we've spent years perfecting our Node.js production environment setup. This comprehensive guide shares our battle-tested Node.js production deployment best practices, focusing on performance optimization, monitoring, and the lessons we've learned scaling Node.js applications to handle millions of daily transactions.


## Our 573% Single Core Performance Optimization Revolution

When we migrated from Intel to AMD Ryzen processors, we achieved a **573% performance improvement** in our Node.js applications. This wasn't just a minor optimizationâ€”it fundamentally changed how our Node.js applications perform in production and demonstrates the importance of single core performance optimization for any Node.js application.

> \[!TIP]
> For Node.js production deployment best practices, hardware choice is critical. We specifically chose DataPacket hosting for their AMD Ryzen availability because single-core performance is crucial for Node.js applications since JavaScript execution is single-threaded.

### Why Single Core Performance Optimization Matters for Node.js

Our migration from Intel to AMD Ryzen resulted in:

* **573% performance improvement** in request processing (documented in [our status page's GitHub Issue #1519](https://github.com/forwardemail/status.forwardemail.net/issues/1519#issuecomment-2652177671))
* **Eliminated processing delays** to near-instant responses (mentioned in [GitHub Issue #298](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/issues/298))
* **Better price-to-performance ratio** for Node.js production environments
* **Improved response times** across all our application endpoints

The performance boost was so significant that we now consider AMD Ryzen processors essential for any serious Node.js production deployment, whether you're running web applications, APIs, microservices, or any other Node.js workload.

## Node.js Production Environment Setup: Our Technology Stack

Our Node.js production deployment best practices include deliberate technology choices based on years of production experience. Here's what we use and why these choices apply to any Node.js application:

### Package Manager: pnpm for Production Efficiency

**What we use:** [`pnpm`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/package.json) (pinned version)

We chose pnpm over npm and yarn for our Node.js production environment setup because:

* **Faster installation times** in CI/CD pipelines
* **Disk space efficiency** through hard linking
* **Strict dependency resolution** that prevents phantom dependencies
* **Better performance** in production deployments

> \[!NOTE]
> As part of our Node.js production deployment best practices, we pin exact versions of critical tools like pnpm to ensure consistent behavior across all environments and team members' machines.

**Implementation details:**

* [Our package.json configuration](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/package.json)
* [Our NPM ecosystem blog post](https://forwardemail.net/blog/docs/how-npm-packages-billion-downloads-shaped-javascript-ecosystem)

### Web Framework: Koa for Modern Node.js Production

**What we use:**

* [`@koa/router`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/package.json)
* [`@koa/multer`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/package.json)
* [`@ladjs/koa-simple-ratelimit`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/package.json)

We chose Koa over Express for our Node.js production infrastructure because of its modern async/await support and cleaner middleware composition. Our founder Nick Baugh contributed to both Express and Koa, giving us deep insight into both frameworks for production use.

These patterns apply whether you're building REST APIs, GraphQL servers, web applications, or microservices.

**Our implementation examples:**

* [Web server setup](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/web.js)
* [API server configuration](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/api.js)
* [Contact forms implementation guide](https://forwardemail.net/blog/docs/how-to-javascript-contact-forms-node-js)

### Background Job Processing: Bree for Production Reliability

**What we use:** [`bree`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/package.json) scheduler

We created and maintain Bree because existing job schedulers didn't meet our needs for worker thread support and modern JavaScript features in production Node.js environments. This applies to any Node.js application that needs background processing, scheduled tasks, or worker threads.

**Our implementation examples:**

* [Bree server setup](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/bree.js)
* [All our job definitions](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/tree/master/jobs)
* [PM2 health check job](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/jobs/check-pm2.js)
* [Cleanup job implementation](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/jobs/cleanup-tmp.js)

### Error Handling: @hapi/boom for Production Reliability

**What we use:** [`@hapi/boom`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/package.json)

We use @hapi/boom for structured error responses throughout our Node.js production applications. This pattern works for any Node.js application that needs consistent error handling.

**Our implementation examples:**

* [Error classification helper](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/helpers/is-code-bug.js)
* [Logger implementation](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/helpers/logger.js)


## How to Monitor Node.js Applications in Production

Our approach to monitoring Node.js applications in production has evolved through years of running applications at scale. We implement monitoring at multiple layers to ensure reliability and performance for any type of Node.js application.

### System-Level Node.js Production Monitoring

**Our core implementation:** [`helpers/monitor-server.js`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/helpers/monitor-server.js)

**What we use:** [`node-os-utils`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/package.json)

Our production monitoring thresholds (from our actual production code):

* **2GB heap size limit** with automatic alerts
* **25% memory usage** warning threshold
* **80% CPU usage** alert threshold
* **75% disk usage** warning threshold

> \[!WARNING]
> These thresholds work for our specific hardware configuration. When implementing Node.js production monitoring, review our monitor-server.js implementation to understand the exact logic and adapt the values for your setup.

### Application-Level Monitoring for Node.js Production

**Our error classification:** [`helpers/is-code-bug.js`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/helpers/is-code-bug.js)

This helper distinguishes between:

* **Actual code bugs** that require immediate attention
* **User errors** that are expected behavior
* **External service failures** that we can't control

This pattern applies to any Node.js application - web apps, APIs, microservices, or background services.

**Our logging implementation:** [`helpers/logger.js`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/helpers/logger.js)

We implement comprehensive field redaction to protect sensitive information while maintaining useful debugging capabilities in our Node.js production environment.

### Application-Specific Monitoring

**Our server implementations:**

* [SMTP server](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/smtp.js)
* [IMAP server](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/imap.js)
* [POP3 server](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/pop3.js)

**Queue monitoring:** We implement 5GB queue limits and 180-second timeouts for request processing to prevent resource exhaustion. These patterns apply to any Node.js application with queues or background processing.


## Node.js Production Monitoring with PM2 Health Checks

We've refined our Node.js production environment setup with PM2 over years of production experience. Our PM2 health checks are essential for maintaining reliability in any Node.js application.

### Our PM2 Health Check System

**Our core implementation:** [`jobs/check-pm2.js`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/jobs/check-pm2.js)

Our Node.js production monitoring with PM2 health checks includes:

* **Runs every 20 minutes** via cron scheduling
* **Requires minimum 15 minutes uptime** before considering a process healthy
* **Validates process status and memory usage**
* **Automatically restarts failed processes**
* **Prevents restart loops** through intelligent health checking

> \[!CAUTION]
> For Node.js production deployment best practices, we require 15+ minutes uptime before considering a process healthy to avoid restart loops. This prevents cascading failures when processes are struggling with memory or other issues.

### Our PM2 Production Configuration

**Our ecosystem setup:** Study our server startup files for Node.js production environment setup:

* [Web server](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/web.js)
* [API server](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/api.js)
* [Bree scheduler](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/bree.js)
* [SMTP server](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/smtp.js)

These patterns apply whether you're running Express apps, Koa servers, GraphQL APIs, or any other Node.js application.

### Automated PM2 Deployment

**PM2 deployment:** [`ansible/playbooks/node.yml`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/ansible/playbooks/node.yml)

We automate our entire PM2 setup through Ansible to ensure consistent Node.js production deployments across all our servers.


## Production Error Handling and Classification System

One of our most valuable Node.js production deployment best practices is intelligent error classification that applies to any Node.js application:

### Our isCodeBug Implementation for Production

**Source:** [`helpers/is-code-bug.js`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/helpers/is-code-bug.js)

This helper provides intelligent error classification for Node.js applications in production to:

* **Prioritize actual bugs** over user errors
* **Improve our incident response** by focusing on real issues
* **Reduce alert fatigue** from expected user errors
* **Better understand** application vs user-generated issues

This pattern works for any Node.js application - whether you're building e-commerce sites, SaaS platforms, APIs, or microservices.

### Integration with Our Production Logging

**Our logger integration:** [`helpers/logger.js`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/helpers/logger.js)

Our logger uses `isCodeBug` to determine alert levels and field redaction, ensuring we get notified about real problems while filtering out noise in our Node.js production environment.

## Advanced Performance Debugging with v8-profiler-next and cpupro

We use advanced profiling tools to analyze heap snapshots and debug OOM (Out of Memory) issues, performance bottlenecks, and Node.js memory problems in our production environment. These tools are essential for any Node.js application experiencing memory leaks or performance issues.

### Our Profiling Approach for Node.js Production

**Tools we recommend:**

* [`v8-profiler-next`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/v8-profiler-next) - For generating heap snapshots and CPU profiles
* [`cpupro`](https://github.com/discoveryjs/cpupro) - For analyzing CPU profiles and heap snapshots

> \[!TIP]
> We use v8-profiler-next and cpupro together to create a complete performance debugging workflow for our Node.js applications. This combination helps us identify memory leaks, performance bottlenecks, and optimize our production code.

### How We Implement Heap Snapshot Analysis

**Our monitoring implementation:** [`helpers/monitor-server.js`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/helpers/monitor-server.js)

Our production monitoring includes automatic heap snapshot generation when memory thresholds are exceeded. This helps us debug OOM issues before they cause application crashes.

**Key implementation patterns:**

* **Automatic snapshots** when heap size exceeds 2GB threshold
* **Signal-based profiling** for on-demand analysis in production
* **Retention policies** for managing snapshot storage
* **Integration with our cleanup jobs** for automated maintenance

### Performance Debugging Workflow

**Study our actual implementation:**

* [Monitor server implementation](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/helpers/monitor-server.js) - Heap monitoring and snapshot generation
* [Cleanup job](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/jobs/cleanup-tmp.js) - Snapshot retention and cleanup
* [Logger integration](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/helpers/logger.js) - Performance logging

### Recommended Implementation for Your Node.js Application

**For heap snapshot analysis:**

1. **Install v8-profiler-next** for snapshot generation
2. **Use cpupro** for analyzing the generated snapshots
3. **Implement monitoring thresholds** similar to our monitor-server.js
4. **Set up automated cleanup** to manage snapshot storage
5. **Create signal handlers** for on-demand profiling in production

**For CPU profiling:**

1. **Generate CPU profiles** during high-load periods
2. **Analyze with cpupro** to identify bottlenecks
3. **Focus on hot paths** and optimization opportunities
4. **Monitor before/after** performance improvements

> \[!WARNING]
> Generating heap snapshots and CPU profiles can impact performance. We recommend implementing throttling and only enabling profiling when investigating specific issues or during maintenance windows.

### Integration with Our Production Monitoring

Our profiling tools integrate with our broader monitoring strategy:

* **Automatic triggering** based on memory/CPU thresholds
* **Alert integration** when performance issues are detected
* **Historical analysis** to track performance trends over time
* **Correlation with application metrics** for comprehensive debugging

This approach has helped us identify and resolve memory leaks, optimize hot code paths, and maintain stable performance in our Node.js production environment.


## Node.js Production Infrastructure Security

We implement comprehensive security for our Node.js production infrastructure through Ansible automation. These practices apply to any Node.js application:

### System-Level Security for Node.js Production

**Our Ansible implementation:** [`ansible/playbooks/security.yml`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/ansible/playbooks/security.yml)

Our key security measures for Node.js production environments:

* **Swap disabled** to prevent sensitive data from being written to disk
* **Core dumps disabled** to prevent memory dumps containing sensitive information
* **USB storage blocked** to prevent unauthorized data access
* **Kernel parameter tuning** for both security and performance

> \[!WARNING]
> When implementing Node.js production deployment best practices, disabling swap can cause out-of-memory kills if your application exceeds available RAM. We monitor memory usage carefully and size our servers appropriately.

### Application Security for Node.js Applications

**Our log field redaction:** [`helpers/logger.js`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/helpers/logger.js)

We redact sensitive fields from logs including passwords, tokens, API keys, and personal information. This protects user privacy while maintaining debugging capabilities in any Node.js production environment.

### Infrastructure Security Automation

**Our complete Ansible setup for Node.js production:**

* [Security playbook](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/ansible/playbooks/security.yml)
* [SSH keys management](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/ansible/playbooks/ssh-keys.yml)
* [Certificate management](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/ansible/playbooks/certificates.yml)

* [Why Open Source Email Security](https://forwardemail.net/blog/docs/why-open-source-email-security-privacy)


## Database Architecture for Node.js Applications

We use a hybrid database approach optimized for our Node.js applications. These patterns can be adapted for any Node.js application:

### SQLite Implementation for Node.js Production

**What we use:**

* [`better-sqlite3`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/package.json)
* [`better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/package.json)

**Our configuration:** [`ansible/playbooks/sqlite.yml`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/ansible/playbooks/sqlite.yml)

We use SQLite for user-specific data in our Node.js applications because it provides:

* **Data isolation** per user/tenant
* **Better performance** for single-user queries
* **Simplified backup** and migration
* **Reduced complexity** compared to shared databases

This pattern works well for SaaS applications, multi-tenant systems, or any Node.js application that needs data isolation.

### MongoDB Implementation for Node.js Production

**What we use:**

* [`@ladjs/mongoose`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/package.json)
* [`@ladjs/mongoose-error-messages`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/package.json)
* [`@zainundin/mongoose-factory`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/package.json)

**Our setup implementation:** [`helpers/setup-mongoose.js`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/helpers/setup-mongoose.js)

**Our configuration:** [`config/mongoose.js`](https://github.com/forwardemail/forwardemail.net/blob/master/config/mongoose.js)

We use MongoDB for application data in our Node.js production environment because it provides:

* **Flexible schema** for evolving data structures
* **Better performance** for complex queries
* **Horizontal scaling** capabilities
* **Rich query language**

> \[!NOTE]
> Our hybrid approach optimizes for our specific use case. Study our actual database usage patterns in the codebase to understand if this approach fits your Node.js application needs.
