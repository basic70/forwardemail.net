## Local Development Guide

Once you have followed [Requirements](#requirements), you should now have all the dependencies, repository, and npm packages installed.

You can start any of the services using our pre-built commands to make it easy.  Note that all of these pre-built commands are using [nps](https://github.com/sezna/nps).

| Service Name | Command             | Default Development Port | Development Preview URL |
| ------------ | ------------------- | :----------------------: | ----------------------- |
| Web          | `npm start web`     |          `3000`          | <http://localhost:3000> |
| API          | `npm start api`     |          `4000`          | <http://localhost:4000> |
| Bree         | `npm start bree`    |           None           | None                    |
| SMTP         | `npm start smtp`    |          `2432`          | `telnet localhost 2432` |
| MX           | `npm start mx`      |          `2525`          | `telnet localhost 2525` |
| IMAP         | `npm start imap`    |          `2113`          | `telnet localhost 2113` |
| POP3         | `npm start pop3`    |          `2115`          | `telnet localhost 2115` |
| SQLite       | `npm start sqlite`  |          `3456`          | `telnet localhost 3456` |
| CalDAV       | `npm start caldav`  |          `5000`          | <http://localhost:5000> |
| CardDAV      | `npm start carddav` |          `6000`          | <http://localhost:6000> |

You can test the local SMTP, IMAP, POP3, CalDAV, CardDAV servers using [Thunderbird](), `telnet`, or `openssl`.  Note that all local development servers do not require TLS and are running with `{ rejectUnauthorized: true }` option passed to TLS server configurations.

Try running the local web server:

```sh
npm start webAndWatch
```

It should open a new tab for you with the local web server running and terminal output using [signale](https://github.com/klaudiosinani/signale).  You can now open your browser to <http://localhost:3000> for a development playground.

**You can also run all apps at once:**

```sh
npm start all
```

Note that if you open your browser to <http://localhost:3000> and no assets are rendering, then you must have forgotten to run a build beforehand.  You can run builds manually by running `npm run build`.

An easy way to kill all existing Node apps running is by typing `killall node`.


## Server Infrastructure

### Naming Convention

Our server alias naming convention consists of the following fields, joined together by a hyphen, and converted to lower case:

1. App name (e.g. "web", "api", "bree", "smtp", "imap", "pop3", "sqlite", "caldav", or "carddav")
2. (Optional) App count (starting with 1) of the application (relative to the same provider and region).  Only applicable for apps with potential count > 1.
3. Provider name (abbreviated to 2 characters, e.g. "do" for "Digital Ocean", but you can optionally use more verbose for providers such as "DataPacket" as "dp")
4. Region name (this is the region name given by the provider, e.g. "sfo3" for DO's SFO3 region)

For example, one of our web servers is named `web-dp-dv-co` (for Web > DataPacket > Denver > Colorado).

### Load Balancing

All server aliases with the same hostname (with a minimum count of at least 2) are set in Cloudflare under a geo-located load balancer.

Unless otherwise noted, all of the servers should have dedicated CPU's and not be running in a shared CPU environment.

### Provisioning

See the [ansible](ansible/) folder for our [Ansible][] configuration and playbooks, which we use to provision servers with.

We recommend you to install [yamllint][] and configure it in your editor while working with [Ansible][] playbooks.

Also note that [ansible-lint][] is a helpful linting tool you can use if you plan on making changes to playbooks.  Note that our current playbooks have several existing lint errors.

First you must provision Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64-bit server(s) using [Digital Ocean][digital-ocean], [Linode][], [Vultr][], or your host of choice.  These newly provisioned server(s) should have your SSH key automatically added.

Follow the [Deployment](#deployment) guide below for automatic provisioning and deployment instructions.

### Deployment

1. Ensure that you have [pm2][] installed locally:

   ```sh
   npm i -g pm2
   ```

2. Ensure that you have [ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html) and [ansible-lint](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/installing/) installed locally:

   > For macOS:

   ```sh
   brew install ansible ansible-lint
   ```

   > For Ubuntu:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ansible
   pip3 install ansible-lint
   ```

3. Install [ansible-galaxy][] requirements (assumes current working directory is the root of this repository):

   ```sh
   ansible-galaxy install -r ansible/requirements.yml
   ```

4. Set up host configuration by copying the `hosts.yml` file template:

   ```sh
   cp ansible/playbooks/templates/hosts.yml hosts.yml
   ```

5. Edit this configuration and update the file with your newly created server aliases and IP addresses.  You can add more than one host to each group if you are setting up load balancing.  Refer to the [Naming Convention](#naming-convention) documentation for our recommended approach to server alias naming.  Note that this file is automatically ignored by git.  If you have a private repository and would like to commit this, then remove `hosts.yml` from the root `.gitignore` file.

   ```sh
   vim hosts.yml
   ```

6. Set up environment configuration by copying the `env` file template:

   ```sh
   cp ansible/playbooks/templates/env .env.production
   ```

7. Edit this configuration and reference the official [Lad][] documentation for a list of all available environment variables (or see [.env.defaults](.env.defaults)).  **You will need to open this file in your preferred editor** and set the values for any fields containing `TODO`, whereby you replace `TODO` with the appropriate value.  Preserve double quotes where they are already defined.

   ```sh
   vim .env.production
   ```

8. Generate [pm2][] [ecosystem files][ecosystem-files] using our automatic template generator. We created an [ansible-playbook.js](ansible-playbook.js) which loads the `.env.production` environment variables rendered with [@ladjs/env][] into `process.env`, which then gets used in the playbooks.  This is a superior, simple, and the only known dotenv approach we know of in Ansible. Newly created `ecosystem-api.json`, `ecosystem-bree.json`, `ecosystem-web.json`, `ecosystem-smtp.json`, `ecosystem-imap.json`, `ecosystem-pop3.json`, `ecosystem-sqlite.json`, `ecosystem-caldav.json`, and `ecosystem-carddav.json` files will now be created for you in the root of the repository.  If you ever more add or change IP addresses, you can simply re-run this command.

   ```sh
   node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/ecosystem.yml -l 'localhost'
   ```

9. Set up the web, API, CalDAV, and CardDAV server(s) (see [patterns and ansible-playbook flags docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_patterns.html#patterns-and-ansible-playbook-flags) if you need help).  If you completely (or partially) run this playbook (or any others below), then the second time you try to run it may not succeed.  This is because we prevent root user access through security hardening.  To workaround this, run the same command but without `--user root` appended as it will default to the `devops` user created.

   ```sh
   node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/http.yml --user root -l 'http'
   ```

10. Set up the Bree server(s):

    ```sh
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/bree.yml --user root -l 'bree'
    ```

11. Set up the SMTP server(s):

    ```sh
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/smtp.yml --user root -l 'smtp'
    ```

12. Set up the IMAP server(s):

    ```sh
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/imap.yml --user root -l 'imap'
    ```

13. Set up the POP3 server(s):

    ```sh
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/pop3.yml --user root -l 'pop3'
    ```

14. Set up the SQLite server(s):

    ```sh
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/sqlite.yml --user root -l 'sqlite'
    ```

15. Set up the MX server(s):

    ```sh
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/mx1.yml --user root -l 'mx1'
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/mx2.yml --user root -l 'mx2'
    ```

16. Set up GitHub deployment keys for all the servers. Note that the `deployment-keys` directory is ignored from git, so if you have a private repository and wish to commit it, then remove `deployment-keys` from the `.gitignore` file.

    ```sh
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/deployment-keys.yml -l 'imap:pop3:smtp:http:bree:sqlite:mx1:mx2' --user deploy
    ```

17. Go to your repository "Settings" page on GitHub, click on "Deploy keys", and then add a deployment key for each servers' deployment key copied to the `deployment-keys` directory.  If you're on macOS, you can use the `pbcopy` command to copy each file's contents to your clipboard.  Use tab completion for speed, and replace the server names and paths with yours.  You can also use the `gh` CLI at <https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_deploy-key_add> as shown below (switch the repo/org/repo paths and deployment key paths below to yours):

    ```sh
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/api-vu-sj-ca.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/api-dp-dv-co.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/web-dp-dv-co.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/web-vu-sj-ca.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/bree-vu-sj-ca.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/bree-dp-dv-co.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/smtp-vu-sj-ca.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/smtp-dp-dv-co-1.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/smtp-dp-dv-co-2.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/smtp-dp-dv-co-3.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/imap-dp-dv-co.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/pop3-vu-sj-ca.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/pop3-dp-dv-co.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/sqlite-dp-dv-co.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/caldav-dp-dv-co.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/carddav-dp-dv-co.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/mx1-dp-dv-co.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    gh repo deploy-key add deployment-keys/mx2-dp-dv-co.pub -R forwardemail/forwardemail.net
    ```

18. Set up PM2 deployment directories on all the servers:

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-web.json production setup
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-api.json production setup
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-bree.json production setup
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-smtp.json production setup
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-imap.json production setup
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-pop3.json production setup
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-sqlite.json production setup
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-caldav.json production setup
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-carddav.json production setup
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-mx.json production setup
    ```

19. Create a SSL certificate at [Namecheap][] (we recommend a 5 year wildcard certificate), set up the certificate, and download and extract the ZIP file with the certificate (emailed to you) to your computer. We do not recommend using tools like [LetsEncrypt][] and `certbot` due to complexity when you have (or scale to) a cluster of servers set up behind load balancers.  In other words, we've tried approaches like `lsyncd` in combination with `crontab` for `certbot` renewals and automatic checking.  Furthermore, using this exposes the server(s) to downtime as ports `80` and `443` may need to be shut down so that `certbot` can use them for certificate generation.  This is not a reliable approach, and simply renewing certificates once a year is vastly simpler and also makes using load balancers trivial.  Instead you can use a provider like [Namecheap][] to get a cheap SSL certificate, then run a few commands as we've documented below. This command will prompt you for an absolute file path to the certificates you downloaded. Renewed your certificate after 1 year? Simply follow this step again.  Do not set a password on the certificate files.  When using the `openssl` command (see Namecheap instructions), you need to use `*.example.com` with an asterisk followed by a period if you are registering a wildcard certificate.

    ```sh
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/certificates.yml --user deploy
    ```

    > **Important:** If you renew or change certificates in the future, then after running the previous command, you will subsequently need to reload the processes as such:

    ```sh
    #
    # NOTE: See the "Important" note above BEFORE running this command.
    #       This command ONLY APPLIES for certificate renewals/changes.
    #
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-web.json production exec "pm2 reload all"
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-api.json production exec "pm2 reload all"
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-smtp.json production exec "pm2 reload all"
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-imap.json production exec "pm2 reload all"
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-pop3.json production exec "pm2 reload all"
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-sqlite.json production exec "pm2 reload all"
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-caldav.json production exec "pm2 reload all"
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-carddav.json production exec "pm2 reload all"
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-mx.json production exec "pm2 reload all"
    ```

20. Create a DKIM key for your domain name (must match `WEB_HOST` environment variable) with a default selector of `default` (must match `DKIM_KEY_SELECTOR` environment variable).  Then upload it to the servers:

    ```sh
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/dkim.yml --user deploy
    ```

21. (Optional) Create a Google application credentials profile file and store it locally.  You only need this if you want to support automatic translation.  The following command will prompt you for the absolute file path (e.g. `/path/to/client-profile.json`).  See the [mandarin][] docs for more information.

    ```sh
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/gapp-creds.yml --user deploy
    ```

22. (Optional) Copy over custom TTF or OTF fonts to be installed on the server (e.g. used for PDF rendering, rendering with Sharp, open-graph images, etc):

    ```sh
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/fonts.yml --user deploy
    ```

    Note that at the time of this writing we copy these files:

    * `inconsolata-dz.otf`
    * `VCHoney-Bold.otf`
    * `VCHoney-Regular.otf`
    * `VCHoney-SemiBold.otf`

23. (Optional) Copy over GPG keys to be installed on the server (e.g. used for GPG signing `security.txt`, see <https://forwardemail.net/security.txt>).

    > **NOTE:** This assumes that you have also set in `.env` file the keys of `GPG_SECURITY_KEY` with the full file path to the key *and* `GPG_SECURITY_PASSPHRASE` with the GPG passphrase. You can export via `gpg --armor --export-secret-key YOURKEYIDHERE > .gpg-security-key`. You can get `YOURKEYIDHERE` via `gpg --list-keys`.  You can generate a key with `gpg --full-generate-key` (e.g. for `support@yourdomain.com` or `security@yourdomain.com`).  Note you should also update the path in `config/index.js` for `openPGPKey` value.

    ```sh
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/gpg-security-key.yml --user deploy
    ```

24. Copy the `.env.production` to the servers:

    ```sh
    node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/env.yml --user deploy
    ```

25. Run an initial deploy to all the servers:

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-web.json production
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-api.json production
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-bree.json production
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-smtp.json production
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-imap.json production
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-pop3.json production
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-sqlite.json production
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-caldav.json production
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-carddav.json production
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-mx.json production
    ```

26. Save the process list on the servers so when if the server were to reboot, it will automatically boot back up the processes:

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-web.json production exec "pm2 save"
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-api.json production exec "pm2 save"
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-bree.json production exec "pm2 save"
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-smtp.json production exec "pm2 save"
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-imap.json production exec "pm2 save"
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-pop3.json production exec "pm2 save"
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-sqlite.json production exec "pm2 save"
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-caldav.json production exec "pm2 save"
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-carddav.json production exec "pm2 save"
    ```

    ```sh
    pm2 deploy ecosystem-mx.json production exec "pm2 save"
    ```

27. Test by visiting your web and API server in your browser (click "proceed to unsafe" site and bypass certificate warning).

28. Configure your DNS records for the web and API server hostnames and respective IP addresses.

29. Test by visiting your web and API server in your browser (in an incognito window).  There should not be any certificate warnings (similar to the one that occurred in step 15).

30. (Optional) Remove the local `.env.production` file for security purposes.  If you do this, then make sure you have a backup, or securely back up off the server in the future before destroying the server.

    ```sh
    rm .env.production
    ```

31. (Optional) Remove the local certificate files you downloaded locally and specified in step 11.  If you do this, then make sure you have a backup, or securely back up off the server in the future before destroying the server.

32. Finished. If you need to deploy again, then push your changes to GitHub `master` branch and then follow step 14 again.  We recommend you to read the [Ansible getting started guide][ansible-guide], as it provides you with insight into commands like `ansible all -a "echo hello"` which can be run across all or specific servers.


## Deployment Advice

If you do not change any assets, then there is no reason to do a full deployment.

For example, if you made changes to a web controller, then you only need to deploy it to the web codebase without a build:

```sh
pm2 deploy ecosystem-web.json production exec "git reset --hard HEAD && git pull origin master && pm2 reload all"
```


## Bare Metal Advice

To set up initial servers, you may need to append the flag `--` to the scripts above, for example:

```sh
node ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/mx2.yml --user ubuntu -l 'mx2' --ask-become-pass
```

If you are provisioning servers after IPMI/VPN access, then you may need to take these additional steps:

1. Remove the `ubuntu` (or other named) default user created during ISO installation:

   ```sh
   sudo deluser --remove-home ubuntu
   ```

2. Resize the disk partition to 100%:

   ```sh
   df -h
   sudo lvdisplay
   sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
   sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv
   df -h
   ```

3. Setup `crypttab` for auto-mount of LUKS encrypted root volume:

   > **Important:** if you have multiple LUKS devices you cannot use these steps below.
   > Instead you will need to modify the one-liner commands below to specifically replace UUID value.
   > This guide only accounts for one LUKS encrypted volume (e.g. use `sudo blkid | grep "crypto_LUKS"` or [refer to this guide](https://www.golinuxcloud.com/mount-luks-encrypted-disk-partition-linux/) to determine your values).

   > Run the following commands individually:

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir /etc/luks
   sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/luks/root.keyfile bs=4096 count=1
   sudo chmod 700 /etc/luks
   sudo chmod 400 /etc/luks/root.keyfile
   sudo cryptsetup luksAddKey $(sudo blkid | grep "crypto_LUKS" | cut -d ':' -f 1 | head -n 1) /etc/luks/root.keyfile
   echo "KEYFILE_PATTERN=/etc/luks/*.keyfile" | sudo tee -a /etc/cryptsetup-initramfs/conf-hook
   echo "UMASK=0077" | sudo tee -a /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf
   sudo sed -i '/dm_crypt-0/d' /etc/crypttab
   echo "dm_crypt-0 UUID=$(sudo blkid | grep "crypto_LUKS" | cut -d '"' -f 2 | head -n 1) /etc/luks/root.keyfile luks,discard" | sudo tee -a /etc/crypttab > /dev/null
   ```

   ```sh
   sudo vim /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/cryptroot
   ```

   ```diff
   +#!/bin/sh
   +cp /etc/crypttab "${DESTDIR}/cryptroot/crypttab"
   +sed -i 's/\/etc\/luks\/root\.keyfile/\/cryptroot\/keyfiles\/dm_crypt-0\.key/' "${DESTDIR}/cryptroot/crypttab"
   +exit 0
   ```

   ```sh
   sudo chmod +x /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/cryptroot
   sudo update-initramfs -c -k all
   ```

   > **NOTE:** THE REST OF THIS STEP IS NOT MEANT TO BE COPIED/PASTED, IT IS A SECTION DEDICATED FOR DEBUGGING:

   If you get sent to a `BusyBox` shell on reboot, then something in your configuration is wrong.

   Fortunately you can regain access by running the following command ([source](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/708445/etc-crypttab-not-updating-in-initramfs#:\~:text=I%20was%20able%20to%20successfully%20boot%20the%20system%20again%20by%20entering%20the%20following%20commands%20at%20the%20BusyBox%20prompt%3A)):

   Note that the path to `/dev/nvme0n1p3` will instead be the path to your device in `/dev` that uses LUKS encryption for mounting as the root volume (in our case it's a NVMe SSD, hence `nvme` in the name).

   ```sh
   sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme0n1p3 dm_crypt-0
   exit
   ```

   Additionally, you can inspect your `initrd` image (the generated file from `sudo update-initramfs -c -k all`) using these commands ([source](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/767065)):

   ```sh
   sudo update-initramfs -c -k all
   ```

   ```sh
   sudo -i
   rm -rf /tmp/x
   mkdir /tmp/x
   cd /tmp/x
   unmkinitramfs -v /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r) .
   cd /tmp/x/main/cryptroot/crypttab
   ll
   ```

4. If you need to configure IPv6 on your server, here is an example network config:

   ```sh
   sudo vim /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/90-installer-network.cfg
   ```

   > Replace `IPV4_GOES_HERE` with IPv4 address, `IPV6_GOES_HERE` with IPv6 address, `IPV6_GATEWAY` with IPv6 gateway, and `IPV4_GATEWAY` with IPV4 gateway:

   > For a comparison of `802.3ad` and other parameter mode values such as `balance-rr`, [please see this article on ServerFault](https://serverfault.com/a/481271).

   > You may need to remove or change the `transmit-hash-policy` as well for your configuration.

   ```sh
   # This is the network config written by 'subiquity'
   network:
     bonds:
       bond0:
         addresses:
         - IPV4_GOES_HERE/24
         - IPV6_GOES_HERE/64
         interfaces:
         - enp1s0f0
         - enp1s0f1
         nameservers:
           addresses:
           - 1.1.1.1
           - 1.0.0.1
           - 2606:4700:4700::1111
           - 2606:4700:4700::1001
           search: []
         parameters:
           mode: 802.3ad
           transmit-hash-policy: layer3+4
         routes:
         - to: ::/0
           via: IPV6_GATEWAY
         - to: default
           via: IPV4_GATEWAY
     ethernets:
       enp1s0f0: {}
       enp1s0f1: {}
     version: 2
   ```

5. If you need to encrypt and auto-mount a disk, e.g. NVMe SSD drive at `/mnt/storage_do_1` for SQLite (`SQLITE_STORAGE_PATH`; see `helpers/get-path-to-database.js`):

   1. Get partition name:

      ```sh
      lsblk
      ```

   2. Encrypt partition with LUKS:

      > **NOTE:** Do not use `aes-xts-plain` – instead you should use `aes-xts-plain64` as shown below – this is because `aes-xts-plain` has limitations on larger containers over 2 TiB and does not offer the same protection as `aes-xts-plain64`.

      > **NOTE:** Replace `nvme1n1` with the name of the unencrypted partition shown in step 1:

      ```sh
      mkdir -p /etc/luks-keys
      sudo touch /etc/luks-keys/key.key
      sudo chmod 400 /etc/luks-keys/key.key
      sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/luks-keys/key.key bs=4096 count=1
      sudo cryptsetup --cipher aes-xts-plain64 --key-file=/etc/luks-keys/key.key --key-size 512 --hash sha512 -v luksFormat /dev/nvme1n1 --batch-mode
      ```

   3. Open the partition:

      > **NOTE:** Replace `nvme1n1` with the name of the unencrypted partition shown in step 1:

      ```sh
      sudo cryptsetup -v --key-file=/etc/luks-keys/key.key luksOpen /dev/nvme1n1 nvme1n1
      ```

   4. Get UUID of storage device:

      ```sh
      sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/nvme1n1 | grep UUID | sed -e "s/UUID: //" | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//;s/[[:space:]]*$//'
      ```

      > **NOTE:** This will output a UUID value such as the following, which you need to use later:

      ```sh
      f0f59f79-f8f8-4a39-8dd7-a04ccc5e50a3
      ```

   5. Add to `/etc/crypttab`:

      > **NOTE:** Replace `nvme1n1` with the name of the unencrypted partition shown in step 1:

      > **NOTE:** Replace the `UUID` value with the value output from above.

      ```sh
      echo "nvme1n1 UUID=f0f59f79-f8f8-4a39-8dd7-a04ccc5e50a3 /etc/luks-keys/key.key luks" | sudo tee -a /etc/crypttab
      ```

   6. Initialize mapper:

      > **NOTE:** Replace `nvme1n1` with the name of the unencrypted partition shown in step 1:

      ```sh
      sudo cryptdisks_start nvme1n1
      ```

   7. Create partition:

      > **NOTE:** Replace `nvme1n1` with the name of the unencrypted partition shown in step 1:

      ```sh
      sudo mkfs -t ext4 -L nvme1n1 /dev/mapper/nvme1n1
      ```

   8. Add to `/etc/fstab`:

      > **NOTE:** Replace `nvme1n1` with the name of the unencrypted partition shown in step 1:

      ```sh
      echo "/dev/mapper/nvme1n1 /mnt/storage_do_1 ext4 defaults 0 2" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
      ```

   9. Mount it and adjust permissions to `deploy` user:

      ```sh
      sudo mkdir -p /mnt/storage_do_1
      sudo mount -a
      sudo chown -R deploy:deploy /mnt/storage_do_1
      ```
